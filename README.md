# TicTacToe
This is a single player TicTacToe game which can be played in the terminal by taking in arguments.
The board is created by using '|' and '-' characters.

The user is first prompted for their name.
A coin is then flipped deciding whether the player or the computer makes the first move.

In order to make a move, the user must enter an integer from the range of 1-9 which corresponds to a spot on the grid.
Regardless of who goes first, the computer will never allow the user to win.
The game will always result in either the computer winning or forcing a draw.
